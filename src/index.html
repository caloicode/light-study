        <h1>Villa Savoye</h1>
        <p>Villa Savoye is a renowned modernist villa designed by the Swiss-French architect Le Corbusier. Completed in 1931, it is located in Poissy, France, and stands as an iconic example of Le Corbusier's "Five Points of Modern Architecture." These principles include the use of pilotis (supporting columns), a functional roof terrace, an open floor plan, horizontal windows, and a free façade design. The villa's sleek, minimalist aesthetic and innovative design have made it a masterpiece of 20th-century architecture, symbolizing the harmony between form and function.</p>
